# ReactYouTubeClone

A web app that emulates the basic functionality of Youtube. I built this app to learn React using Stephen Grider's Udemy course: https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter

### Getting Started
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/oliverpople/ReactYouTubeClone.git
> cd ReactYouTubeClone
> npm install
> npm start
```

You will also need to add your own API_KEY to src/components/index.js file.

### Getting API key 

Visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis and register to generate your own 'YouTube Data API v3' key.
